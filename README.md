## Overview of scripts
**analyzeBehavior.ipynb**: started writing in 2020 to analyze behavioral data for the cue-reward association task. Primary plots consist of: trial accuracy by training day, arm selection over time, and trial accuracy by cue type.

**accuracySimple.ipynb**: made in 2022 as a simpler version of the performance plot from analyzeBehavior. Instead of using the raw trial outcomes, it uses the calculated percentages which are in a separete csv. As I improve analyzeBehavior it should become obsolete.

**positionTracking.ipynb**: made in January 2023 to analyze tracking data.
