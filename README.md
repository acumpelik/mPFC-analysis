# mPFC-analysis

## Overview of scrips
**8-arm-maze-performance.ipynb**: created before my qual to represent the expected learning curve (back when I expected each daily session to have 6 trials)

**analyzeBehavior.ipynb**: plotted only JC240 and JC241; very simple figure

**analyzeBehavior-v2.ipynb**: made while I was taking the datavis course; more primed for aesthetics since I was trying to extrapolate what the final learning curve 
would look like for multiple animals, so I plotted the SEM instead of individual lines for each animal. Also plotted the arm choice.

**analyzeBehavior-v3.ipynb**: fixed some aesthetics and cosmetic aspects specifically for a datavis assignment

**analyzeBehavior-202104-progress-review.ipynb**: made for the October 2020 progress review; plots all the animals I did, even the unusable ones

**analyzeBehavior-v4-20210706.ipynb**: decided to add the date to the filename to keep track; don't think I'll do this in the future

**analyzeBehavior-v5.ipynb**: created on 7/20/2021 to work with only animals I'll use (at least for behavior)
